# Notes
### Bugs
Issue: Fix euro € symbol causing the whole line to be highlighted as misspelled.
Possible utf8 lib https://github.com/tst2005/lua-utf8string/blob/master/utf8string.lua
                  https://github.com/t1m1yep/utf8/blob/main/utf8.lua
                  https://github.com/blitmap/lua-utf8-simple/blob/master/utf8_simple.lua
*Might require Lua 5.3 and not be compatible with the Wow Lua env.
Wow _G.bit has the bit functions needed by some of these utf8 implementations.

**Fixed - Issue: Wow 11 - War Within, issue loading interface options (Misspellec.lua: 1417 disabled for now)
Looking to convert addon options to use AceConfig.

### WoW Forever and Midnight (9/2026)
WoW Forever runs the Midnight (12.x) client: interface **16001**, `WOW_PROJECT_ID == WOW_PROJECT_MAINLINE`, Retail APIs (`C_AddOns`, `ChatFrameUtil`, `MenuUtil`, the Settings panel), and Midnight's addon restrictions and secret values. Verified against Blizzard's UI source for Forever (Gethe/wow-ui-source, `forever` branch, 1.60.1.70124).
- TOC: `## Interface` includes 16001, and `## Interface-Forever: 16001` is for the BigWigs packager, which builds a Forever package with `-g forever` (see `.github/workflows/release.yml`).
- `C_ChatInfo.SendChatMessage` is restricted (`HasRestrictions`). It's blocked for addon-tainted callers while `C_ChatInfo.InChatMessagingLockdown()` is true (encounters, Mythic+, PvP). `C_RestrictedActions.IsAddOnRestrictionActive(Enum.AddOnRestrictionType.*)` reports Combat, Encounter, ChallengeMode, PvPMatch, Map and Chat restrictions.
- `EditBox:GetText()` / `GetCursorPosition()` can return secret values (`SecretReturnsForAspect` Text / Cursor). Always check `issecretvalue` first.

Rules the chat code follows so it doesn't taint Blizzard's chat:
- Never hook or replace `SendChatMessage` / `C_ChatInfo.SendChatMessage`.
- Never call `SetText`, `Insert`, `HighlightText`, `SetFocus` or `SetAttribute` on a Blizzard chat edit box automatically. `SetText` runs Blizzard's `OnTextChanged` / `ParseText` under taint. The only write is picking a suggestion out of combat (`ReplaceWord`). While restricted (`CanReplaceWords`) the suggestions are greyed out with a polled `SetEnabled` function, and `ReplaceWord` does nothing.
- Only post-hooks: `HookScript`, `hooksecurefunc`. Never `SetScript` on Blizzard frames, and never write fields onto them (state lives in weak-keyed tables).
- Misspellings are underlined on Misspelled's own overlay frame (a child of the edit box).

Still to check in the live Forever client:
- Underlines line up with the words, including long messages that scroll sideways (`ComputeScroll` follows the caret, since there's no API for the edit box's scroll offset).
- Right-click on an underlined word opens the menu; in combat and encounters the suggestions are greyed out with the "paused" note, and grey out if combat starts while the menu is open.
- Chat messages and `/cast`-style slash commands still go through during a boss encounter (no ADDON_ACTION_BLOCKED).

### Tests
`lua5.1 tests/run.lua` runs offline tests (needs Lua 5.1 and Lua BitOp: `apt install lua5.1 lua-bitop`). They load the real addon code and the enUS dictionary against stubbed WoW APIs, so they check the logic, not what it looks like in game.
